SUMMARY="Wondershare EdrawMind is a full-featured cross-platform mind mapping and brainstorming tool. Whether you are an employee, an entrepreneur, a student, or a freelancer, you can use Wondershare EdrawMind to develop more ideas, boost creativity, and streamline your workflow."
#If the package "desktop-file-utils" is not installed in Debian, Edrawmind's post-install script may return some errors. But the app installs and launches regardless.
#However, this may cause deb-get to think the installation failed. So to uninstall, you may need to use Apt instead of deb-get.
